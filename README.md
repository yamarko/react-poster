## How to Run the Project

To run the project, you need to open **two terminal windows** and execute the following commands:

1. In the **first terminal**, navigate to the **dummy-backend** directory and start the Node server:
   ```bash
   cd dummy-backend
   npm start
   ```
2. In **the second terminal**, navigate to the **frontend** directory and start the React development server:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   ```
Make sure both servers are running to fully access the application.
